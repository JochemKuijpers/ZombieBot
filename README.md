# ZombieBot
A simple Telegram bot responding to everything you say with a random message.

Written and tested with Python 3.4.3

## Getting started

This bot can serve as an example for getting started in programming your own bot.

Please note that this bot is meant to run in privacy mode. You can enable privacy mode for your own bot by talking to @BotFather: https://telegram.me/BotFather?setprivacy

If you want to run this code for your own bot, create a second file `config.py` and add your own token:

    token = 'your_token_here'
